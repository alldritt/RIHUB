# RIHUB

An iOS and macOS application for connecting to and controlling the LEGO Robot Inventor controller.

## Status

This app does not yet do anything useful.  I'm still working out the CodeBluetooth connectivity.  

## Future

### Stage 1

My goal is to get Bluetooth and USB connectivity to the Robot Inventor controller worked out and display the state of all the sensors (Gyro, accel, Color, Distance), and motors in real-time.

### Stage 2

Provide integration between the Robot Inventor controller and other applications on iOS and macOS.  For iOS, this may involve Shortcuts and for macOS this may involve AppleScript, Automator or Unix scripting.

### Stage 3

We'll see what arises.
